# Snake_Game
my attempt at making a snake game.  thanks to bro code for inspiration.  


I used innosetupcompiler for the installer and launch4j for the main exe.  Just use the arrow keys to move and press enter to restart.  Note: you can actually restart 
at any time, even while you are playing the game.  I am not able to sign exe files so your computer will probably flag them as viruses.  enjoy!
